# hello-world
This is me learning Github
My name is Gerald and I'm working on bettering myself by learning new things. As I get older I want my mind to stay sharp. I've read studies that suggest that learning new things and doing mental actives like reading and doing puzzles can help to keep the brain sharp well into the twilight year.
